- 👋 Hi, I’m Jamie. I build tech communities for humans and am currently head of the community program at Contentstack.
- 👀 I love learning new things, especially about the intersection between humans and technology. I write in variations of the most complex computing languages known: human language.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning SQL, javascript, and python, and brushing up on the latest CSS and HTML standards.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on cool projects, build new community management best practices, and support humanitarian, environmental, ecological, and societal well-being.
- 📫 You can find me on Twitter @techlorax or working on my pet project: https://communityforhumans.build
