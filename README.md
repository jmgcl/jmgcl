#I am a
👋 Hi, I’m Jamie. I build communities to bring humans together around shared interests. Most of my experience is with developer communities. Lately, I've been doing a lot of work in the startup space and I am currently the Sr. Director of Community (Head of Community) at Unusual Ventures. 

#Lifelong Learner
👀 I love learning new things, especially about the intersection between humans and technology. I write in variations of the most complex computing languages known: human language.
🌱 I’m currently learning SQL, javascript, and python, and brushing up on the latest CSS and HTML standards.

#Looking for Friends
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on cool projects, build new community management best practices, and support humanitarian, environmental, ecological, and societal well-being.

#To Give Back
🌟 You can find me on Twitter @techlorax or check out my recent appearances in the community:
